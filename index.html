    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words
        </p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">Use a secure web hosting provider: The first step is to choose a reputable web hosting provider that prioritizes security. Ensure that the hosting provider offers SSL/TLS encryption and provides regular backups.
      Keep software updated: Outdated software is a common vulnerability exploited by attackers. Ensure that all software, including the operating system, web server software, and content management systems (CMS), are updated regularly.
      Use strong passwords: Passwords should be strong and unique for each account. Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.
      Implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): 2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide a second factor, such as a code or biometric authentication, in addition to their password.
      Use HTTPS: Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) encrypts all data sent between the website and the user's browser, making it more difficult for attackers to intercept and steal sensitive data.
      Implement security plugins: Security plugins can help detect and prevent attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and other common vulnerabilities.
      Regularly backup data: Regularly backing up website data is important in case of a security breach or a website crash.
      Regularly scan for vulnerabilities: Regular vulnerability scans can help identify any weaknesses in the website's security before they are exploited by attackers.</p>
